    * Reference issues in commits

    * Further tests for Github automation (still works with formatted?)\

*Decision* about Pull Requests

    * We'll start forcing reviews

Picking a framework: React vs Angular
    * Pick a tutorial for each and decide

    * Facebook vs Google

    * Library vs Framework

TravisCI permissions

    * Camil is on it

IDE Choice
    
    * Still to be chosen

Fixed Issue template

Story Points

    * Using Fibbonacci
