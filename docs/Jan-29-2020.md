*	Pull requests to develop branch instead of master. Save Master for stable things

*	Or not because of continuous integration

*	Or make a branch for the sprint and then merge to master at the end of the sprint

*	Pull request created for read me, needs to be merged

*	Pull request for webpack coming soon

*	Webpack can do cool stuff, but we are trying to keep it simple

*	Also easy to integrate frameworks

*	IDE choice: VS code or Rider :

*	Rider : Once we upload project, it syncs settings to make stuff easier

*	Plugin for Webpack in Rider

*	Azure cloud as a possible host

*	Have high level design meeting next week

*	Processes: Tag issues properly: Issue = Story, Milestone = Sprint, Global backlog = Unassigned and no milestone, Sprint backlog = Unassigned and has a milestone

*	Wiki pages have been added: Git commands and other things that should be read

*	Continuous integrating tool needs to be added

*	To make it easier to know who knows how to do what: We each create a wiki page and list what kind of programming or other relevant experience we have. Internships, projects and classes.
