# March 4 2020

* Introduce PlantUML workflow to the team

  * [Example available](User-Account-Login.md) from [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentlaurent/ShutterFeed-a-soen-341-repo/master/docs/User-Account-Login.md)

  * The Class diagram is more than what is asked

    * We just need a MVC (simple) diagram (Judy, Laurent & Camil)

* Testing discussions

  * `ng lint` and `ng test` are setup through Travis

* Core features we're 2/3

  * Still need Following (Tommy is leading the feature)

  * Still need Notifications (Tommy is leading the feature)

* Issues

  * Working on making more issues for the next Sprint

    * We'll figure Jasmine testing for next Sprint

  * Will update tasks for this Sprint (Judy & Camil)

* Looking at Grading Scheme

  * Code is readable, other points on Grading Scheme has been done throughout the course of the previous Sprints

* Additional Features we're working on

  * "Story"

    * Will have to support pictures (default length of displayed picture is 5s)

      * After which, it will exit the picture

  * Alternate Username generator

    * Might want to refactor this feature

    * Will change it to "Having a User name" (not linked to their google username bc that sucks tbh)

      * Unique Usernames will be a requirement

* Travis continuous delivery

  * Maybe look into Environment Variables, it might help

  * Otherwise, for now, it is quite complex since we'll have to add some conditional deployment (so that it only deploys from `master`).
