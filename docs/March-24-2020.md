This meeting was called by Camil to update everyone on the ShutterFeed Stories feature.

* Work has been done on it: The user can upload a Story to our backend.
* Difficulty: Getting the picture to show up in a separate container than the feed.
* Next Step: Judy will figure out how to display the picture. Once done, Camil, Tommy and Judy will work on periodically deleting expired stories from the backend.
