We talked about:
* Our core feature 1 and 2 are really well made. Nice!
* We discussed when we would be available to work on the project next

Our next steps:
* Have to figure out how to test the features (acceptance tests)
* Have to build the scenarios for testing in TravisCI
* Have to figure out how not to hardcode the usernames in the comments
* Have to flesh out the user profile
* Use the same logic (that will be used to avoid hardcoding the username in the comments) in order to implement core feature 3
* Make the UI scale to mobile
* Reinforce the first 2 features (better exception handling)
* Extra: Nightly gitlab pipeline (we need to see if TravisCI can ran nightly tests)
