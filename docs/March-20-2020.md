This was a meeting where Camil and Tommy discussed the backend architecture for the ShutterFeed Stories feature. It was decided that:

* The user would not be responsible for removing the story from our backend: this will be done automatically.
* The images from stories should not be kept in the same location a the images from the feed in our backend.
* The call to post stories would be similar to the call to post pictures on the feed.
