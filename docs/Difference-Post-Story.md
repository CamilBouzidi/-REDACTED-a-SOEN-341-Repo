# Difference between a Post and a Story

* A post is related to our first three user stories.

Namely, a post is a picture that appears on the shared ShutterFeed feed that users can interact with by commenting. This post is permanent and will always stay on the feed.

* A Story is related to our fourth user story.

Essentially, a Story permits a user to share pictures without compromising the overall feed. By uploading a picture as a Story, a user can set for how long this picture will appear above the feed and for how long it will stay in our database. Thus, users still get to share their individual pictures without modifying the feed!
