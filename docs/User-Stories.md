**[User Story 1: Upload Pictures](https://github.com/CamilBouzidi/-REDACTED-a-SOEN-341-Repo/issues/8)**

As a user, I want to upload pictures on my account in order to share my life with my friends from a distance. I would not want to be limited in the type of picture that I could upload. Obviously, I would want this service to be fast and reliable.

**[User Story 2: Leave comments on a posted picture](https://github.com/CamilBouzidi/-REDACTED-a-SOEN-341-Repo/issues/13)**

As a user, I want to be able to comment on a picture to let others know how I feel about the picture. This will send a notification to the user who posted the picture.

**[User Story 3: Follow other users](https://github.com/CamilBouzidi/-REDACTED-a-SOEN-341-Repo/issues/15)** 

As a user, I would like to keep up with other users' feeds by following their accounts on the platform. Similarly, I would want other users to be able to follow me on the platform. I would like to get notified when a user starts following me and vice versa.

**[User Story 4 (Additional Feature): ShutterFeed Stories](https://github.com/CamilBouzidi/-REDACTED-a-SOEN-341-Repo/issues/24)**

As a user, I would like to be able to upload pictures that would disappear after a day, separately from my main feed of pictures (say, in my Story). That way, I would still be able to update my followers on my day-to-day life without compromising the aesthetic or themes of my feed.
