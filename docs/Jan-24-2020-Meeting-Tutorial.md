Meeting with TA:
* Extra features are not necessary, but they are very welcome. As long as we have core features,we won’t lose any marks.
* Implied in the 3 core features:
* Receiving notifications whenever you are followed
* Receive a notification when someone who you follow posts a picture
* Being able to see a feed of people who you follow.

After Meeting with TA:
* Tommy recommended our DEV env is compatible with REACT.
* Get rid of Front End and Back End folders.
* .NET CORE seems ideal to use with VS Code, especially because of extensions NuGet is a great tool.
* Recommended VS Code extensions:
* Nuget Package Manager Console
* Webpack extension
* Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools
* Add Node.js to our PCs
* Install .NET Core 3.1 SDK
•	Get familiar with Webpack for FE
•	So far, name is PhotoFeed. Please let us know if you have any other ideas!
