## Languages and Techniques

### Languages
This project could benefit from having a HTML, CSS, Javascript front-end and a C#/.NET CORE back-end to leverage existing work-experience from project members.

### Techniques
For the basic prototype, the possibility of hosting a local server is being considered. Ideally, the team will settle on having a server hosted on a platform like AWS as soon as possible.
