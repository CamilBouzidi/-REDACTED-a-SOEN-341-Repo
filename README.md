## Languages and Techniques

### Languages
This project could benefit from having an Angular front-end and a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) back-end to leverage existing work-experience from project members.

### Techniques
The project is being hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform's. It allows for domain hosting, database design and storage. Moreover, it offers a authentification plug-in that uses Google Accounts.

A library called [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire) gives developer access to Firebase functions and modules from their Angular code.
